# React.js Portfolio

## Description
A single portfolio page showcasing a developers work using **create-react-app** that is deployed using `gh-pages`.

## Deployed URL
[Cynthia Godoy's React.js Portfolio]()

## Installation

1. To install react packages: [Getting Started with React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/)
```
npx create-react-app react.js-portfolio
```

2. To install [react router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router)
```
npm install react-router-dom
```

3. To install [react icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-icons)
```
npm install react-icons
```

3. [Create React App Docs on GitHub Pages](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages). **Note**: `gh-pages` requires a seperate build that can be deployed.

## Usage
Inside the directory, react can run several commands:

`npm start` starts the development server

`npm test` starts the test mode

`npm run build` bundles the app into static file for production

`npm eject` will remove the tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files and scripts into the app directory. If you do this you can't go back!

## Items Completed

✅ The `Navbar` navigates to sections of the portfolio with the current section highlighted and appears on multiple pages.

✅ The `About Me` section includes a photo of the developer. The `Resume` button contains a downloadable resume and a list of developers proficiencies.

✅ The `Portfolio` section includes 6 of the developer's applications with links to both the deployed application and the GitHub Repositories.

✅ The `Contact` section contains a contact form with fields for name, email address, and a message. A cursor over the field will indicate that the field is required. If invalid email is entered into the form the user will recieve notification that that the email is invalid. **Note**: Because this application doesn’t include a back end or connect to an API, the contact form doesn't save this information right now.

✅ The `Footer` section contains the icon links to the developer's GitHub, Linkedin, and a profile to a third platform.
